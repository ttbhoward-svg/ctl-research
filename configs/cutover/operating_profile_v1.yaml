# Operating Profile v1 — Locked configuration for cutover cycle.
#
# This file is the machine-readable source of truth for the current
# operational state.  The gate script (scripts/check_operating_profile.py)
# re-derives acceptance from live diagnostics and compares against the
# expected statuses recorded here.

# Do NOT edit expected_status values without a corresponding decision-log
# entry in docs/governance/cutover_h2_h3_decision_log.md.
